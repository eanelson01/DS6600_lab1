### Discussion of the License

For this project, I chose the GNU General Public License v3.0. This license allows other people to use the materials for both commercial and private use, as well as for their own distribution and modification of the materials. This material can not be taken and given a license that is different from the GNU General Public LIcesnse v3.0. This ensures that the material is not given a more restrictive license. 

If I did not supply a license, this material would have the standard copyright laws and would not allow others to modify it. This would hamper future collaboration and material enhancement from others.

### .gitignore File Location

The part of the .gitignore file that relates to .env files can be seen below. It is just the ".env" line in the .gitignore file.
